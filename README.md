# The PETALE Project
This repository stores the code implemented to generate the results of our paper:  
*Machine learning strategies to predict late adverse effects in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors*

**The datasets analysed during the study are not publicly available for confidentiality purposes.
However, randomly generated datasets with the same format as used in our experiments are publicly
shared in the** ```data``` **directory**.

## Installation
To have all the requirements needed, you must do the following actions:
- Open a terminal
- Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/Rayn2402/ThePetaleProject.git```
- Move into the directory: ```cd ThePetaleProject/```
- Create a virtual environment with conda: ```conda env create --file settings/env.yml```
- Activate your new environment: ```conda activate petale```
  
## Test the implementation
You can write the following lines in a terminal to replicate our experiments using the **randomly generated** data stored
in the ```data``` directory. Records of the experiments will be stored in ```records/experiments``` directory
as they will be completed.

- VO2 peak:  
```python replicate_study.py -d generated -t vo2```
  
- Obesity (w/o SNPs):  
```python replicate_study.py -d generated -t obesity```
  
- Obesity (w/ SNPs):  
```python replicate_study.py -d generated -t obesity -gen```
  
It is also possible to run a fast version of each experiment by adding the ```-fast``` argument.
The fast version uses **2** rounds of stratified random sampling, instead of **10**,
to evaluate each model and hyperparameter sets.

Specs of our computer and execution times recorded for each experiment
are displayed below.   

- Computer model:  Alienware Aurora Ryzen Edition
- Linux version: Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 3900X 12-Core Processor
- GPU: None were used for our experiments

| Experiment         | Time (fast)    | Time (normal)    |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------|
| VO2                | 42 min         | 4 hours 11 min.  |
| Obesity (w/o SNPs) | 1 hour 1 min.  | 7 hours 8 min.   |
| Obesity (w/ SNPs)  | 2 hours 7 min. | 16 hours 39 min. |
